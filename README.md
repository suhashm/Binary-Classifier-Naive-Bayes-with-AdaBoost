# Binary-Classifier-Naive-Bayes
Binary Classification:Naive Bayes and AdaBoost implementation in Java

* Implemented Naïve Bayes Classifier in Java to predict whether a car purchased at auction is a lemon or not. This was as part of Kaggle competition sponsored by Carvana. [http://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked](http://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked)
* Implemented AdaBoost – an ensemble method to improve the accuracy of the Naïve Bayes Classifier. The classifier was able to predict whether a car is good buy or not on real world test data set with comparable accuracy.
