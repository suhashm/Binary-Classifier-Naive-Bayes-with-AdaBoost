This was as part of Kaggle competition sponsored by Carvana. [http://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked](http://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked)\r\n* Implemented AdaBoost – an ensemble method to improve the accuracy of the Naïve Bayes Classifier. The classifier was able to predict whether a car is good buy or not on real world test data set with comparable accuracy.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
